**Summary of RVK Memorandum: Channing Small Cap Value Equity - Contract Renewal**

**Recommendation:** RVK recommends the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System (LAFPP) renew its contract with Channing Small Cap Value Equity for three years, aligning with LAFPP staff's recommendation. Despite short-term underperformance in Q1 2025 due to tariff-driven market volatility, Channing rebounded in Q2 with a gross return of 10.7%, ranking in the 9th percentile of its peer group. RVK views this performance deviation as acceptable given the volatile nature of US small-cap equity and Channing’s concentrated portfolio approach.
